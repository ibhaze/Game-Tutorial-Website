                    <strong>1. Karim Benzema (Real Madrid/France, 91 OVR)</strong>
                    The French striker gained two rating points from last year's game, which helps him ascend to being the best player in FIFA 23--marking the first time in over a decade that the top overall ranking wasn't occupied by Messi or Ronaldo. Benzema breaks the six-way tie at 91 overall with higher ratings in passing, dribbling, and speed over the second-ranked Lewandowski, earning him the top spot.
                    <strong>2. Robert Lewandowski (FC Barcelona/Poland, 91 OVR)</strong>
                    The second of six players tied at 91 overall, Lewandowski beats out the third-ranked Mbappe for second overall thanks to higher marks in shooting, defense, and physicality. The Polish striker is the all-time leading goal scorer in Polish history, with his tough, physical presence overpowering defenders around the world.
                    <strong>3. Kylian Mbappe (Paris Saint-Germain/France, 91 OVR)</strong>
                    The cover star for FIFA 23, Mbappe's incredibly fast and efficient style put him in the top three best players in the game this year. He scored nine goals in seven games for Paris Saint-Germain in 2022, increasing his career totals with the team to 180 goals in 224 appearances. He also added three more goals in four appearances with the French national team.
