                        <p>My name is Thomas and im the leader of the Group "Game Tutorial Allience". I have some experience in making a website using 
                            html and css because i already did a semester in media design in Fontys University of Applied Sciences. My responsibility inside the 
                            group is to work on the tasks and make sure all tasks are finishes on time. Inside the website I helped everyone 
                            with difficulties they had with the css. I also made the design/template for the pages where you choose a tutorial and for 
                            the actual tutorials itself. I also made the tutorials for Overwatch 2 and Hollow Knight.

                        <p>My name is Danya and I am a member of Game Tutorial Alliance. I have some experience in Html and CSS through my studies in Fontys
                            University of Applied Sciences where I have been working on the websites for Pizzeria's. My responsibility inside of the group is to, as everyone,
                            work together with my teammates on the tasks. I am also responsible for keeping track of things we are doing and need to do.
                            I also take responsibilty to organise the group when leader is not present. Inside of the website itself my contribution was to create the sidebar 
                            navigation and to create the genre pages. And, of course, I am responsible to make a tutorial for the game I choose, which is CSGO.
